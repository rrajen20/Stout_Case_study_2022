# DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

# In[303]:


#Graph 1 : Interest_rate
#Since our target variable in interest rate, we would first see the distribution of interest rate    
#we can see there are some outliers in the Interest rate

sns.boxplot(loansdf['interest_rate'])

plt.savefig("Employment Length Vs Interest Rate.jpg")
#The plot below shows that there is non - linear relationship between the two variables,but we can observe that
#Also the interest rate seems to be high for the ones having less employment years as uncertainity in the employment could be a high risk for lending club.
#The interest rates are also oberved to be high for the years 7 and 4,the reason i think could be because of credit history(little or no).So I assume that employment
#length should be used to predict the model.

#Graph 3 
#Debt to Income Ratio
#As per my intuition,dti helps in determining the interest rate,its the ratio b/w the current debt and the income,
#lower the DTI, lower the interest rate offered as they see you as a low risk borrower and vice versa.

# DATA PREPROCESSING
# 
# -I did an intuitive approach and some references from Lending Club website to study the data and understand the importance of each variable in predicting the interest rate which is our target variable.I found out the importance of many variables in determining the Interest rate,like the DTI ,FICO score which are most important variable in approving a loan and if approved assigning the interest rate,but our data did not have the FICO score.
# 
# -Data pre-processing was done based on the analysis in the above step and steps include,removing the variables     which contained more than 80% of missing values.
# 
# -Imputation was performed with mean values for those variables which had missing and NaN values.
# 
# -Correlation heat map was created to understand the variables which are highly correlated ,greater than .7 and those variables were carefully removed after analysing their importance on the target variable.
# 
# -After performing the above steps,there were some variables which could cause potential data leakage,hence they were also dropped.

#trees to get the optimum result by choosing the majority among them as the best value.
#Since we are working on many decision trees,the overfitting might not occur,accuracy might be higher

#compared to our MODEL 2 ,though the RMSE value of RF model is less.

#using gradient descent on the loss function of each sub-model. The model then combines the accuracies of each model,
#using a weighted sum of predictions, to produce a best-fitting or highest-performing model.
#The speed of the models are valued as well.

# The RMSE of both the models donot show a major difference but based on the Computational speed,XGB has outperformed Random forest and also its unique features and high capability in considering other factors we could choose this model to be robust.
# 
# Observations and Suggestions :
# All the feature selection,refining and model was done based on my research and knowledge obtained from my education,this could not be the final version of the code,a few other effceient ways could be incorporated.
# The Feature Importance graph shows subgrade,grade to be the highly correlated,so more indepth analysis of them could have been done.Data wrangling was done purely by the research done and many of the features could have been removed but i wanted to check the model's performance by retaining most of the features and check the efficiency.
# Predicting the interest rate- both model has predicted and aligned with the actuals with slight deviations.
# There are better Neural Network models which on implementation could have yielded a more effective prediction without compromisng on other factors.
